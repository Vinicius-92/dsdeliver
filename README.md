# Delivery Application with backend with Java and Frontend with React
### Created during the week project of NÃ©lio Alves, at DevSuperior

## What I learned?
  * Got a deeper understanding of organization of Java projects
  * Had the chance of uploading the backend into Heroku and the frontend to Netlify
  * Used React for the first time and learned more about how frontend works
  * How to make the CRUD methods with the database using DTO
